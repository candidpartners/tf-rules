Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

+ aws_default_vpc.default
      id:                               <computed>
      assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block: <computed>
      cidr_block:                       <computed>
      default_network_acl_id:           <computed>
      default_route_table_id:           <computed>
      default_security_group_id:        <computed>
      dhcp_options_id:                  <computed>
      enable_classiclink:               <computed>
      enable_classiclink_dns_support:   <computed>
      enable_dns_hostnames:             <computed>
      enable_dns_support:               "true"
      instance_tenancy:                 <computed>
      ipv6_association_id:              <computed>
      ipv6_cidr_block:                  <computed>
      main_route_table_id:              <computed>
      tags.%:                           "1"
      tags.Name:                        "Default VPC"
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
