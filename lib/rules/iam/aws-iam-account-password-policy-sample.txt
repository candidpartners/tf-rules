Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

+ aws_iam_account_password_policy.strict
      id:                             <computed>
      allow_users_to_change_password: "true"
      expire_passwords:               <computed>
      hard_expiry:                    <computed>
      max_password_age:               "90"
      minimum_password_length:        "8"
      password_reuse_prevention:      "1"
      require_lowercase_characters:   "true"
      require_numbers:                "true"
      require_symbols:                "true"
      require_uppercase_characters:   "true"
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
